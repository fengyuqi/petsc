1) Need to give each object its own Processor set, instead of using those from the framework

2) Can replace use of LIBS/CPPFLAGS with extraArguments and DEL it after use

3) Need to protect data structures in the framework udpated by configure objects. I am tempted to
   just have the configure process return a tuple of updates which gets merged in the the master.
